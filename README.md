# ERP_System
ERP system using PHP and MySQL


## ASSUMPTIONS
 I created a modern type UI using just Bootstrap 5 , HTML5 , CSS3. I imported fonts from the Google Fonts and I used only bootstrap icons for the menu. I added alerts from bootstrap and then I created a table to visualized the data that the user submits from the form. And I validate every data that form submits to ensure the user enters correct data into ERP System Database. I prevented the user from inserting null data into database by checking the data twice from a loop.
